Project 1: PCR Simiulation

This project is a simulation of the PCR process for an assumed 50
cycles. Please note, this program was tested and runs on Python3.7. To
run the program use the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py

If you do not run the pip install you will not be able to generate the
chart for the simulation. If you wish to disable this you must go into
the main.py file and comment out line 129.
